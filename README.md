# ðŸ’» Coding Samurai Internship Task â€“ Python Projects

Welcome to my submission for the **Coding Samurai Internship**, where I completed several practical Python GUI projects using **Tkinter**, **CustomTkinter**, and **APIs**. These projects demonstrate my ability to build real-world desktop applications with clean interfaces, responsive logic, and API integration.

---

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Tkinter** â€“ for basic GUI development
- **CustomTkinter** â€“ for modern and styled GUI components
- **Requests** â€“ for making HTTP requests to APIs
- **OpenWeatherMap API** â€“ for live weather data
- **Datetime** â€“ for working with date/time
- **JSON** â€“ for parsing API responses
- **Random** â€“ for number generation (used in games)

## ðŸ“Œ Project 1: Weather App

### ðŸŒ¦ Description

A desktop GUI application that fetches live weather data for any city entered by the user using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The weather data is displayed in a structured and user-friendly interface.

### âœ¨ Features

- Enter any city name to get real-time weather info
- Shows:
  - Temperature (Â°C)
  - Weather description (e.g., Clear, Rain, Snow)
  - Humidity %
  - Wind speed (km/h)
- Error handling (e.g., city not found, network issues)

### ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Working with REST APIs using Python
- Handling and parsing JSON data
- Creating intuitive user interfaces with Tkinter

## ðŸ“Œ Project 2: To-Do List App

### âœ… Description

An elegant To-Do List desktop application built with `CustomTkinter`. Users can add tasks, delete them, and view their task list in real-time.

### âœ¨ Features

- Add new tasks
- Delete existing tasks
- View all tasks instantly
- Clear error handling for invalid input

### ðŸ§  What I Learned

- GUI application structure using CustomTkinter
- Managing state and updating UI elements dynamically
- Improving user experience with visual design

## ðŸ“Œ Project 3: Calculator App

### ðŸ§® Description

A modern Calculator app built with **CustomTkinter**, providing basic arithmetic operations within a clean and interactive GUI layout.

### âœ¨ Features

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Interactive buttons and responsive input field
- Styled layout using CustomTkinter widgets

### ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Handling button click events
- Real-time equation evaluation
- Designing clear and minimal GUI logic

## ðŸ“Œ Project 4: Number Guessing Game

### ðŸŽ² Description

A fun game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The game offers feedback based on user input and ends after a set number of attempts.

### âœ¨ Features

- Random number generation
- User input field with validation
- Limited attempts with feedback after each guess
- Clean and responsive GUI layout

### ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Using the `random` module
- Creating interactive logic in Python GUI
- Managing state across user attempts
